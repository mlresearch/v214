title: Causal Discovery for Fairness
booktitle: Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness through the Lens of Causality and Privacy
year: '2022'
abstract: Fairness guarantees that the ML decisions do not result in discrimination
  against individuals or minority groups. Identifying and measuring reliably fairness/discrimination
  is better achieved using causality which considers the causal relation, beyond mere
  association, between the sensitive attribute (e.g. gender, race, religion, etc.)
  and the decision (e.g. job hiring, loan granting, etc.). The big impediment to the
  use of causality to address fairness, however, is the unavailability of the causal
  model (typically represented as a causal graph). Existing causal approaches to fairness
  in the literature do not address this problem and assume that the causal model is
  available. In this paper, we do not make such an assumption and we review the major
  algorithms to discover causal relations from observable data. This study focuses
  on causal discovery and its impact on fairness. In particular, we show how different
  causal discovery approaches may result in different causal models and, most importantly,
  how even slight differences between causal models can have significant impact on
  fairness/discrimination conclusions.
