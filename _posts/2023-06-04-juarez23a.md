abstract: As in traditional machine learning models, models trained with federated
  learning may exhibit disparate performance across demographic groups. Model holders
  must identify these disparities to mitigate undue harm to the groups. However, measuring
  a model’s performance in a group requires access to information about group membership
  which, for privacy reasons, often has limited availability. We propose novel locally
  differentially private mechanisms to measure differences in performance across groups
  while protecting the privacy of group membership. To analyze the effectiveness of
  the mechanisms, we bound their error in estimating a disparity when optimized for
  a given privacy budget. Our results show that the error rapidly decreases for realistic
  numbers of participating clients, demonstrating that, contrary to what prior work
  suggested, protecting privacy is not necessarily in conflict with identifying performance
  disparities of federated models.
